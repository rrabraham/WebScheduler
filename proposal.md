### Overall Project Description
We have chosen to do the WebScheduler. We believe the WebScheduler is a valuable asset for students who struggle to opitmize their backpacking capabilites. We expect to have a friendly user interface so that the program can be used by both those who have a background and do not have a background in coding.

### Group Logistics
We have created a groupme, and expect to meet twice a week. We are scheduled to meet on Thursdays and Fridays after 4 PM along with the work we plan to do on our own.
